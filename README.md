# Udacity Front End Nanodegree Project 6- MyReads

## Project Description
This project was built as part of the Udacity FrontEnd Nanodegree curriculum. I was given starter code by Udacity as a template for a static HTML and CSS site. I refactored the code into an interactive React application that allows users to organize by shelf, books that they are currently reading, want to read, and have read. 

## Project Dependencies 
    * react
    * react-dom
    * react-router-dom
    * prop-types
    * sort-by
    * escape-string-regexp

## To launch the app in your browser:
* clone or download this repo
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* run `npm start` in the project root directory to start the development server and launch the   app in the browser window





## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
